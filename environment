# ~/.environment
#
# This is a configuration file for path, umask, aliases, and other personal
# environment settings. It is loaded whenever you log in or open a shell.
#
# Start a new shell (or type 'source ~/.environment' in an existing shell) to
# have these changes take effect.
#
# The shell treats lines beginning with # as comments.
#
# EDIT THIS FILE to modify your path, umask, aliases, or environment variables.
#
# Note: By default, there are a few commands defined for shell-independent
# configuration. YOU SHOULD ONLY USE THESE COMMANDS in this file so that it
# will work from all supported shells.
# The commands are:
#
#   umask value                 set umask
#   setenvvar VAR value         set environment variable
#   setenvifnot VAR value       set env var, if not already set
#   pathappend VAR value        append path element, only if not in path
#   pathappendifdir VAR value   append path element, if exists and not in path
#   pathprepend VAR value       prepend path element, only if not in path
#   pathprependifdir VAR value  prepend path element, if exists and not in path
#   shellcmd name 'command'     define a shell command
#   sourcefile file             source a file, if it exists
#

# 
# Umask
#
# The umask controls the permissions inherited by new files created from a
# shell or a child process. here's a table of some umask values you might
# use. See also tcsh(1) and chmod(1).
#
# note that files created from nano will have the umask of the process
# that started nano, so for the safest behavior, set your umask and then
# start nano from a shell, or create new files in the shell. see touch(1).
